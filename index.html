                        <h5>Okay, let the ranting begin!</h5>
                        <p> <h3>1. Comparison is The Thief of Joy</h3>                         
                            The crazy part is that regardless of how good you think you are, someone is ahead of you in some way. There is always going to be that person who has gotten to where you want to be, and if you constantly compare yourself to others, then over time, you'll lose sight of your achievements, and soon, your confidence will falter. Acknowledge the progress of others, but don't forget that you are unique, and so is your journey.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <h3>2. Do Not Try Controlling The Things You Can't</h3> I firmly believe that with hard work and perseverance, what is yours will not pass you by. Emphasis on 'Hard work' I think it is really important to do your best and work hard for what you want, but there is a stage we get to that we have little influence over, and at this point, chill, and your hard work will speak for you.                
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     <h3>3. Learn to Rest</h3> The one I learnt the hard way! There is always something you could be doing- assignments, projects, etc.- but sometimes, you need to intentionally prioritise rest. Feeling rested is much more important than many think because mental well-being is essential in feeling prepared to be your best. For some people like myself, resting equalled unproductivity, and I had to change that mindset to avoid reaching a point of burnout. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h3>4. Avoid Setting Restrictions Too Early</h3> A lot of the time, we think we know what we want to do, and this makes us avoid the things we think we don't want to do. In fact, one thing I quickly learnt was to say yes to almost everything. Join societies, speak to different people, explore various careers, and avoid setting a limit on what you can't and can do, especially early in your journey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h3>5. Don't Set Unrealistic Expectations For Yourself</h3> Even students who consistently topped their classes in high school and maintained exceptional grades can testify that university was a bit of a blow. University is not supposed to be easy; it intends to challenge and stretch your limits. Work hard, but do not beat yourself up if your grades are not what they used to be.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h3>6. Confidence is Key</h3> I've realised that at university, people are mostly clueless, but many are good at hiding that cluelessness by seeming confident. Basically, fake it till you make it! Practice being confident until you are indeed confident in your abilities, your work ethic, and your achievements.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <h3>7. The Imposter Syndrome is Real</h3> Feelings of 'am I meant to be here?' 'Everybody but myself seems fine.' 'They are better than me' are real and undoubtedly universal, but the best way to get through those feelings is to avoid comparison, understand that you won't be the only one feeling that way, and trust in the abilities that brought you to where you are now.
